# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

The DriverPass project is a software that can be run on standard desktops and mobile platforms. The DriverPass company wanted to create this software so 
that they can provide a service for student drivers. With this software, they provide online practice tests for written exams that are up to date will all DMV
standards. The software also allows the students to schedule practice driving tests from a pool of driver instructors. The student is allowed to chose one of four
packages provided by the DriverPass company. 

I feel that I did my UML diagrams particularly well. I feel that all of my UML diagrams that were created for the project were not only detailed, but easy to follow 
and understand. I feel that a business person that has no information technology background would be able to follow along with the processes described within my
UML diagrams.

If I could revise a document, it would be my business requirements document. I feel that there was a lot of redundancy within it. I could improve on it by going through
and taking out certain things to make the whole thing less redundant in general.

The user's needs were implemented into the system design by providing multiple ways for them to access the system. The user could access the DriverPass system though
any desktop operating system or mobile device. The user could also still schedule appoointments via telephone when calling the secretary. The user has many avenues 
when chosing how to interact with the DriverPass software. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because the user is what is going to generate
revenue for the DriverPass company. With a good software design, the DriverPass company will be making a profit.

When approaching designing a software I feel that it is important to get as many details as possible when talking to the company. I would prepare a set of questions 
when sitting down and speaking with the company and figure out exactly how they want their software to run, how they want it to look, and what they want it to do. 
I would also take notes and try and get all contact information incase of any follow up questions that may occur.
